# Music-Score-Reader
Optical music recognition (OMR) has been the subject of research for decades. An accessible and easy-to-use OMR application could provide an amazing tool for improving the musical education experience. For example, a novice musician could use such a tool to hear what a selected piece of music should sound like. Ideally, an OMR, given an image of a simple or complex music sheet, automatically identifies the notes, and plays the musical piece. For this project, our goal is to develop an algorithm to parse music sheet images, produce the associated annotation, and implement a playback mechanism for the parsed musical notes.
